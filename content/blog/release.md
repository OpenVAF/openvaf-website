Today is another day for celebration: 

The OpenVAF beta test phase is completed and we have uploaded a first release version of OpenVAF that is not 
considered "beta" anymore. 
OpenVAF integration is now available in the latest Ngspice release and can thus reach a broader audience. 

We have received many bug reports that helped us improve the software. 
In particular rigorous testing of OpenVAF by the Ngspice team must be acknowledged here.  

We hope to be able to attend a few conferences this year and meet face-to-face with people that use OpenVAF. 
Furthermore, we have some exciting news that we cannot share yet, so stay tuned!
