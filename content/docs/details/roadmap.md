# Roadmap

OpenVAF is still in development and there many goals we aim to achieve in the longterm:

- Noise analysis *(planned for 2023)*
- Reaching full compliance with the Verilog-A standard
  - Behavior modelling features
  - Support for features that allow defining full circuits/full PDKs in Verilog-A
- OSDI integration in Xyce
- Improved documentation
- A detailed paper about the technical innovations in OpenVAF and attendance at international conferences
<!-- - An automated **test-suite** for open-source circuit simulators -->

We are always looking for cooperation partners, please 
do not hesitate to contact [SemiMod GmbH](https://www.semimod.de).
