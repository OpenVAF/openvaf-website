Today, after long development, we have finally reached a long awaited development milestone:
The first beta version of OpenVAF is available was made available to a limited group of people and
will be announced publicly soon.
Today we are also launching a first version of this website which contains documentation,
examples, technical details and benchmarks.

There is a long journey still ahead of us as we continue to improve both OpenVAF and our documentation.
However, we are already proud of what we have accomplished so far.
OpenVAF easily outperforms all other Verilog-A compilers we [benchmarked](../../docs/details/performance)
Furthermore support for [OSDI](../../docs/details/osdi) **landed in the ngspice pre-master branch today**.
With that support for OpenVAF is slated to be included in the upcoming ngspice 39 release.

If you don't mind building the pre-master branch yourself,
you can already try out [some examples](../../docs/getting-started/examples).
