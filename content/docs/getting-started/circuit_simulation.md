## Ngspice Installation

In the following paragraphs, the simulation of some circuits that rely on Verilog-A defined compact models is detailed using Ngspice 
as an exemplary circuit simulator. 
For this purpose, please install Ngspice as is explained on the Ngspice website (todo:Link).

**Note that currently, the OSDI interface of Ngspice is only available in the pre-master branch!**

## Netlist Syntax 

TODO: Describe how to include models

## Example 1: HICUM/L2 Model

## Example 2: MOS circuit

## Example 3: Holger circuit
