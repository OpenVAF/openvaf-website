The [Spice OPUS](https://www.spiceopus.si/) developers have recently integrated our OSDI interface into their simulator (release 3.0) and thereby 
enabled Verilog-A support in their tool. We are very excited to hear this and wish them all the best!

This shows that the OSDI documentation is on a level that enables other developers to independently 
integrate OSDI into their simulators. 
Also, the Spice OPUS devs have contributed valuable feedback to further improve OpenVAF.
