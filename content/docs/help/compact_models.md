## Available compact models

This chapter of the OpenVAF documentation resembles an in-complete list of Verilog-A compact models that are available online. 
Do not hesitate to drop us a mail if we forgot your favorite model!

Note that for legal reasons, OpenVAF does not ship with these models. Users are encouraged to download them themselves. 
We also encourage users to only employ freely available models.
