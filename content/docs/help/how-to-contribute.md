# Contributing and Support

OpenVAF development primarily takes place on [github](https://github.com/pascalkuthe/OpenVAF).
If you run into problems, please open an [issue](https://github.com/pascalkuthe/OpenVAF/issues).
Everyone is also invited to contribute to this project by forking the project and opening a [pull request](https://github.com/pascalkuthe/OpenVAF/pulls).
Development related details can be found in the README of the [github repository](https://github.com/pascalkuthe/OpenVAF).
You are invited to ask questions in a [discussion](https://github.com/pascalkuthe/OpenVAF/discussions), create pull requests and report bugs. 


OSDI support for `ngspice` is maintained inside the ngspice repo [here](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/).
The OSDI integration can be found in `src/osdi`.
Problems that occur during simulation instead of during compilation should be reported to the [ngspice bugtracker](https://sourceforge.net/p/ngspice/bugs/).
If the problem turns out to be caused by OpenVAF it will be moved to the OpenVAF bug tracker.
<!-- * The **OSDI** interface definition is maintained [here](https://gitlab.com/mario.k/osdi) and is summarized [here](/osdi/osdi_v0p3.pdf). -->
