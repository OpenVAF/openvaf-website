Recently, Arpad Bürmen has released the [VACASK](https://codeberg.org/arpadbuermen/VACASK) circuit simulator 
which makes heavy use of the OpenVAF circuit simulator for compiling its device models. 
It is also exciting to see that several bugfixes for OpenVAF have been released in [his clone](https://github.com/arpadbuermen/OpenVAF) of our OpenVAF repository. 
We are happy to see this development and hope this new tool will have a substantial impact on the open-source community.
