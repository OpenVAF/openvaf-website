Today, after long development, we have finally reached a long awaited development milestone:
A beta version of OpenVAF is now available to a limited group of people. 
Furthermore, we are also launching a first version of the OpenVAF website which contains documentation,
examples, technical details and benchmarks.

While we are proud of what OpenVAF can do today, there is a long journey ahead of us as we continue to improve both OpenVAF and the documentation.
OpenVAF already outperforms all other Verilog-A compilers that [have been benchmarked by us](../../docs/details/performance). 
Furthermore, support for [OSDI](../../docs/details/osdi) **is available in the ngspice pre-master branch today** 
and will be included in the ngspice 39 release. 

If you don't mind building the Ngspice pre-master branch yourself, you can already try out [some OpenVAF examples](../../docs/getting-started/examples).
