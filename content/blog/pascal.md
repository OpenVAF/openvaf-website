Unfortunately, the former main developer of OpenVAF has left SemiMod and is no longer active in the OpenVAF project. 
Due to additional issues that will not me bade public, SemiMod is no longer able to financially support this great project.

Still, the power of open-source will carry the project on. Several individuals have started to fix bugs in their clones of the repository 
and further develop OpenVAF. 
OpenVAF is used on a daily basis by many people and we sincerely hope it will remain useful for the whole community.
We especially thank IHP for their valuable support.
